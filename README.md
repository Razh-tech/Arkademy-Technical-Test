RESTful APIs and JSON
Source : lynda.com

Developers can interact remotely with a WordPress site from a client-side or external
application by using the WordPress REST API. Using JSON objects, this API allows you to 
create and send content to a site, request information from a site, update existing content, 
and even create single page applications on top of WordPress. This course takes a 
detailed look at putting the WordPress REST API to use, demonstrating the use of routes, 
endpoints, arguments, requests, responses, and more. Technologies covered include 
RESTful APIs, JSON, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, and AJAX.

Topics include:
- Using a REST client to communicate with a REST API
- Reviewing available routes, endpoints, and arguments
- Adding custom post types and taxonomies
- Altering the API response
- Using PHP for resiliency
- Passing info using wp_localize_script()
- Setting up a REST API request through AJAX
- Outputting selected post data to the front end
- Formatting post data to match a theme
- Triggering AJAX for an infinite scroll effect
- Setting up the core HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Using AJAX to load subsequent responses
